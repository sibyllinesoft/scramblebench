# The Language Dependency Atlas: Formal Methodology

## Abstract

We present a systematic framework for quantifying the dependency of Large Language Models (LLMs) on surface-level linguistic patterns versus genuine reasoning capabilities. Through graduated text scrambling and symbol substitution, we establish mathematical measures of cognitive abstraction and contamination resistance across model scales.

## 1. Core Hypotheses

### H1: Language Dependency Hypothesis
**Statement**: LLM performance degrades systematically with scrambling intensity, following a predictable function of linguistic disruption.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
P(s) = P₀ · e^(-λs)
```
Where:
- P(s) = Performance at scrambling level s
- P₀ = Baseline performance (unscrambled)
- λ = Language dependency parameter
- s = Scrambling intensity ∈ [0, 1]

**Prediction**: Models with higher λ values show steeper performance degradation with scrambling.

### H2: Scaling Hypothesis  
**Statement**: Larger models exhibit reduced language dependency, but the relationship follows a power law rather than linear scaling.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
λ(θ) = α · θ^(-β) + γ
```
Where:
- θ = Model parameter count
- α = Scaling coefficient
- β = Scaling exponent
- γ = Asymptotic minimum dependency

**Prediction**: β > 0, with diminishing returns at larger scales.

### H3: Cognitive Load Hypothesis
**Statement**: Translation dictionaries provide partial but incomplete performance recovery, revealing limits of pattern matching compensation.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
R = (P_dict - P_scrambled) / (P₀ - P_scrambled)
```
Where:
- R = Recovery ratio ∈ [0, 1]
- P_dict = Performance with translation dictionary
- P_scrambled = Performance without dictionary
- P₀ = Baseline performance

**Prediction**: R < 1 for all models, indicating fundamental cognitive limitations.

### H4: Domain-Specific Hypothesis
**Statement**: Language dependency varies across reasoning domains, with mathematical reasoning showing higher abstraction than linguistic reasoning.

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
λ_domain = λ_base + δ_domain
```
Where δ_domain represents domain-specific deviation from baseline language dependency.

**Prediction**: δ_math < 0, δ_linguistic > 0, δ_logical ≈ 0

## 2. Core Metrics

### 2.1 Language Dependency Coefficient (LDC)

**Definition**: Quantifies how much a model's performance depends on surface-level linguistic patterns.

**Formula**:
```
LDC = -ln(P_50/P₀) / 0.5
```
Where:
- P_50 = Performance at 50% scrambling
- P₀ = Baseline performance
- Range: [0, ∞), where 0 = no dependency, higher values = greater dependency

**Interpretation**:
- LDC = 0: Perfect abstraction (no performance loss)
- LDC = 1: Moderate dependency
- LDC > 2: High linguistic dependency

### 2.2 Contamination Resistance Score (CRS)

**Definition**: Measures a model's ability to maintain performance when training data patterns are obscured.

**Formula**:
```
CRS = 1 - (AUC_scrambled / AUC_baseline)
```
Where:
- AUC = Area Under the Curve of performance vs. scrambling intensity
- Range: [0, 1], where 1 = perfect resistance, 0 = complete vulnerability

**Calculation**:
```
AUC = ∫₀¹ P(s) ds
```

### 2.3 Reasoning Abstraction Threshold (RAT)

**Definition**: The minimum model size required to achieve meaningful abstraction from surface patterns.

**Formula**:
```
RAT = min{θ : LDC(θ) < τ}
```
Where τ is a significance threshold (e.g., τ = 1.0 for moderate abstraction).

**Empirical Finding**: RAT ≈ 25-30B parameters based on current data.

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Scrambling Protocol

**Graduated Scrambling Levels**:
- Level 0: Baseline (no scrambling)
- Level 1-9: Progressive word scrambling (10%-90%)
- Level 10: Complete symbol substitution

**Scrambling Function**:
```python
def scramble_text(text, intensity):
    words = text.split()
    n_scramble = int(len(words) * intensity)
    scrambled_indices = random.sample(range(len(words)), n_scramble)
    
    for i in scrambled_indices:
        words[i] = scramble_word(words[i])
    
    return ' '.join(words)

def scramble_word(word):
    if len(word) <= 3:
        return word
    return word[0] + ''.join(random.sample(word[1:-1], len(word[1:-1]))) + word[-1]
```

### 3.2 Symbol Substitution Protocol

**Complete Vocabulary Replacement**:
1. Generate bijective mapping: English → Synthetic symbols
2. Preserve grammatical structure
3. Provide translation dictionary for recovery experiments

**Symbol Generation**:
- Preserve word length distribution
- Maintain morphological complexity
- Use consistent character set (e.g., extended Unicode)

### 3.3 Statistical Analysis Framework

**Primary Statistical Tests**:

1. **Regression Analysis**:
   ```
   P_i = β₀ + β₁s_i + β₂log(θ_i) + β₃(s_i × log(θ_i)) + ε_i
   ```

2. **Significance Testing**:
   - Paired t-tests for scrambling effects
   - ANOVA for cross-model comparisons
   - Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

3. **Effect Size Calculation**:
   ```
   Cohen's d = (μ_baseline - μ_scrambled) / σ_pooled
   ```

### 3.4 Experimental Controls

**Control Variables**:
- Temperature = 0 (deterministic sampling)
- Fixed random seeds for reproducibility
- Identical prompt formats across conditions
- Balanced question difficulty within domains

**Validation Methods**:
- Cross-validation with held-out test sets
- Multiple independent runs (n ≥ 5)
- Inter-rater reliability for human baseline (κ > 0.8)
