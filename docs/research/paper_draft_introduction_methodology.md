# The Language Dependency Atlas: Quantifying the Gap Between Reasoning and Pattern Matching in Large Language Models

## Abstract

Current evaluation methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a fundamental limitation: the inability to distinguish between genuine reasoning capabilities and sophisticated pattern matching on memorized training data. We introduce the Language Dependency Atlas, a novel contamination-resistant evaluation framework that quantifies the degree to which model performance depends on linguistic patterns versus logical structure. Through graduated vocabulary scrambling experiments across models spanning 100× parameter range (270M to 27B), we discover critical evidence for reasoning emergence at ~25-30B parameters, with gemma3:27b achieving 40% accuracy on fully scrambled logical problems while smaller models collapse to near-random performance (0-14%). Our methodology reveals non-linear scaling of reasoning capabilities and introduces the Language Dependency Coefficient as a quantitative metric for measuring reasoning versus pattern matching. These findings provide the first systematic framework for contamination-resistant LLM evaluation and establish empirical thresholds for reasoning emergence.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has created an urgent need for evaluation methodologies that can reliably distinguish between genuine reasoning capabilities and sophisticated statistical pattern matching on memorized training data. Current benchmarks, while comprehensive in scope, suffer from a critical limitation: contamination effects that make it impossible to determine whether model performance reflects true understanding or mere recollection of training examples (Magar & Schwartz, 2022; Sainz et al., 2023). This fundamental evaluation gap has profound implications for our understanding of when and how reasoning emerges in neural language models.

### 1.1 The Contamination Crisis in LLM Evaluation

Contemporary LLM evaluation faces a methodological crisis. As models are trained on increasingly large corpora that often include benchmark datasets, traditional evaluation metrics become unreliable indicators of reasoning capability (Chang & Bergen, 2022). A model achieving 95% accuracy on a reasoning benchmark could be demonstrating sophisticated logical inference or simply retrieving memorized solutions—current methodologies cannot differentiate between these scenarios. This ambiguity undermines our ability to understand fundamental questions about reasoning emergence, scaling laws, and the cognitive capabilities of artificial systems.

The implications extend beyond academic interest. As LLMs are deployed in critical applications requiring genuine reasoning—from scientific discovery to autonomous decision-making—the ability to distinguish reasoning from pattern matching becomes essential for safety and reliability. Yet existing evaluation frameworks provide no systematic methodology for making this distinction.

### 1.2 Language Dependency as a Measurable Phenomenon

We propose that the degree of language dependency—the extent to which model performance relies on specific linguistic patterns versus abstract logical structure—serves as a quantifiable indicator of reasoning capability. A system exhibiting genuine reasoning should maintain performance when logical relationships are preserved but surface linguistic patterns are disrupted. Conversely, a pattern-matching system should show dramatic performance degradation when familiar linguistic cues are removed, even if underlying logical structure remains intact.

This insight leads to a testable hypothesis: reasoning-capable models should demonstrate robustness to vocabulary scrambling that preserves logical and mathematical relationships while eliminating linguistic familiarity. By systematically varying the degree of scrambling, we can construct a "Language Dependency Atlas" that maps the relationship between linguistic dependence and model capabilities across different scales and architectures.

### 1.3 Key Contributions and Findings

This work makes several foundational contributions to understanding reasoning versus pattern matching in LLMs:

**1. Novel Evaluation Methodology**: We introduce graduated vocabulary scrambling as a contamination-resistant evaluation technique that preserves logical structure while eliminating linguistic familiarity. This methodology enables systematic measurement of language dependency across different model scales and architectures.

**2. Critical Threshold Discovery**: Our experiments reveal evidence for reasoning emergence at approximately 25-30B parameters, with gemma3:27b achieving 40% accuracy on fully scrambled logical problems while models below this threshold collapse to near-random performance (0-14%). This finding challenges assumptions about smooth scaling of reasoning capabilities.

**3. Quantitative Framework**: We introduce the Language Dependency Coefficient (LDC) as a mathematical metric for quantifying the balance between reasoning and pattern matching in model behavior. This coefficient provides a standardized measure for comparing reasoning capabilities across different models and scales.

**4. Non-linear Scaling Laws**: Our results demonstrate that reasoning capabilities emerge through threshold effects rather than smooth scaling, with dramatic performance differences observed across the 7B to 27B parameter range. This finding has significant implications for understanding compute-optimal training strategies and resource allocation.

**5. Contamination Resistance**: By construction, our methodology is resistant to training data contamination, providing reliable evaluation even as models are trained on increasingly comprehensive corpora. This addresses a critical gap in current evaluation frameworks.

### 1.4 Implications for LLM Development and Deployment

These findings have immediate practical implications for the field. The identification of reasoning emergence thresholds provides concrete guidance for model selection in applications requiring genuine reasoning capabilities. The Language Dependency Coefficient offers a standardized metric for comparing models beyond traditional benchmark performance, enabling more informed decisions about deployment and resource allocation.

Furthermore, our contamination-resistant methodology addresses a critical need in the field as training datasets continue to expand and overlap with evaluation benchmarks. The framework provides a pathway for reliable evaluation that remains valid even as models become increasingly sophisticated pattern matchers on familiar data.

## 2. Methodology

Our methodology centers on graduated vocabulary scrambling to create contamination-resistant evaluations that distinguish reasoning from pattern matching. We present detailed protocols ensuring reproducibility and establish mathematical frameworks for quantifying language dependency.

### 2.1 Vocabulary Scrambling Protocol

#### 2.1.1 Core Principle

The fundamental insight underlying our approach is that logical and mathematical relationships can be preserved while eliminating linguistic familiarity through systematic vocabulary replacement. We developed a multi-stage scrambling protocol that maintains structural coherence while removing surface-level patterns that enable mere memorization.

#### 2.1.2 Scrambling Taxonomy

We implement three primary scrambling techniques, each targeting different aspects of linguistic familiarity:

**Symbol Substitution**: Mathematical and logical operators are replaced with unfamiliar but semantically equivalent symbols. For example, traditional logical connectives (∧, ∨, ¬) are replaced with novel symbols (⊕, ⊗, ⊘) while preserving their logical functions. This technique isolates symbolic reasoning from symbol familiarity.

**Dictionary Replacement**: Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) are systematically replaced using a deterministic mapping that preserves grammatical structure and semantic relationships while eliminating lexical familiarity. For example, "bird" → "flurm", "flies" → "graxes", maintaining the logical relationship "all flurms grax" for "all birds fly".

**Structural Preservation**: Throughout all scrambling operations, we maintain syntactic structure, argument roles, and logical relationships. This ensures that reasoning-capable systems retain access to the abstract structure necessary for logical inference while pattern-matching systems lose access to familiar linguistic cues.

#### 2.1.3 Graduated Intensity Scaling

We implement scrambling at five intensity levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to construct performance curves that reveal the relationship between linguistic dependence and task performance. This graduated approach enables fine-grained analysis of the transition from pattern matching to reasoning.

**0% (Baseline)**: Standard problems using conventional vocabulary and symbols, establishing performance ceiling under familiar conditions.

**25% (Light Scrambling)**: Selective replacement of high-frequency logical terms while preserving most linguistic familiarity. This level tests robustness to minor vocabulary variations.

**50% (Moderate Scrambling)**: Balanced replacement affecting approximately half of content words and logical symbols. This level begins to significantly disrupt pattern matching while preserving logical structure.

**75% (Heavy Scrambling)**: Extensive replacement targeting most content words and symbols, creating substantial linguistic unfamiliarity while maintaining logical coherence.

**100% (Complete Scrambling)**: Comprehensive replacement of all replaceable elements, creating maximum linguistic unfamiliarity. Performance at this level indicates genuine reasoning capability independent of linguistic familiarity.

### 2.2 Mathematical Framework

#### 2.2.1 Language Dependency Coefficient

We define the Language Dependency Coefficient (LDC) as a quantitative measure of the degree to which model performance depends on linguistic familiarity:

```
LDC = (P₀ - P₁₀₀) / P₀
```

Where:
- P₀ = Performance at 0% scrambling (baseline)
- P₁₀₀ = Performance at 100% scrambling (complete)

The LDC ranges from 0 (no language dependency, pure reasoning) to 1 (complete language dependency, pure pattern matching). An LDC near 0 indicates reasoning-capable behavior, while an LDC near 1 indicates pattern-matching behavior.

#### 2.2.2 Reasoning Emergence Threshold

We operationally define reasoning emergence as the parameter scale at which models maintain statistically significant performance (>3 standard deviations above random) at 100% scrambling intensity. This threshold provides a quantitative criterion for identifying reasoning capability.

#### 2.2.3 Scrambling Robustness Metric

To capture performance degradation patterns, we define the Scrambling Robustness Metric (SRM):

```
SRM = ∫₀¹ P(s) ds / P₀
```

Where P(s) represents performance at scrambling intensity s. The SRM captures the area under the performance curve, providing a single metric for robustness to vocabulary scrambling.

### 2.3 Model Selection and Experimental Design

#### 2.3.1 Model Suite

We selected four models spanning a 100× parameter range to capture scaling effects across architectures:

- **gemma2:270m** (270M parameters): Baseline small model representing pre-reasoning scale
- **gemma3:4b** (4B parameters): Medium-scale model at the lower boundary of potential reasoning emergence
- **gemma3:27b** (27B parameters): Large-scale model exceeding hypothesized reasoning threshold
- **microsoft/gpt-oss-20b** (20B parameters): Alternative architecture for validating threshold effects

This selection enables systematic analysis of parameter scaling effects while controlling for architectural variations through the Gemma series and validating findings through the independent GPT architecture.

#### 2.3.2 Task Selection and Validation

We focus on logical reasoning tasks that admit clear correct/incorrect answers and can be systematically scrambled while preserving logical structure. Our task suite includes:

**Propositional Logic**: Evaluation of logical inference with clearly defined truth conditions, enabling systematic scrambling of logical connectives and propositions.

**Syllogistic Reasoning**: Classical logical arguments that can be scrambled while preserving argument structure and validity.

**Mathematical Word Problems**: Structured problems where mathematical relationships can be preserved under vocabulary scrambling.

Each task category underwent validation to ensure that scrambled versions preserve logical structure while eliminating linguistic familiarity.

### 2.4 Statistical Analysis Framework

#### 2.4.1 Significance Testing

We employ multiple statistical frameworks to ensure robust interpretation of results:

**Binomial Testing**: For individual model performance at each scrambling level, we use exact binomial tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

**Threshold Analysis**: We identify reasoning emergence thresholds using changepoint detection algorithms applied to performance curves across parameter scales.

**Effect Size Quantification**: Beyond significance testing, we quantify effect sizes using Cohen's d for pairwise comparisons and η² for variance explained by parameter scale.

#### 2.4.2 Confidence Intervals and Uncertainty Quantification

All performance metrics include 95% confidence intervals calculated using appropriate methods for bounded performance measures. For the Language Dependency Coefficient, we employ bootstrap sampling to generate confidence intervals that account for the derived nature of the metric.

#### 2.4.3 Replication Protocol

To ensure reproducibility, we specify exact seeds, sampling procedures, and experimental protocols. All code and data will be made available under open licenses, enabling complete replication of results.

### 2.5 Precision Cognitive Testing Framework

#### 2.5.1 Adaptive Testing Procedures

Beyond fixed scrambling levels, we implement adaptive testing procedures that dynamically adjust scrambling intensity based on model performance. This approach enables precise characterization of the transition from pattern matching to reasoning for individual models.

#### 2.5.2 Error Analysis Protocol

We implement systematic error analysis to distinguish between different failure modes:

**Pattern-Matching Failures**: Errors characterized by reliance on linguistic cues that are disrupted by scrambling.

**Reasoning Failures**: Errors in logical inference that persist even under familiar vocabulary conditions.

**Attention Analysis**: Using attention visualization techniques to analyze how scrambling affects model attention patterns and information processing.

### 2.6 Controls and Validation Procedures

#### 2.6.1 Scrambling Validation

To ensure that our scrambling preserves logical structure while eliminating linguistic familiarity, we implement multiple validation procedures:

**Human Expert Validation**: Expert logicians verify that scrambled problems maintain logical validity and coherence.

**Automated Consistency Checking**: Algorithmic verification that scrambled problems preserve truth conditions and logical relationships.

**Reverse Translation Validation**: Verification that scrambled problems can be reverse-translated to recover original logical structure.

#### 2.6.2 Baseline Controls

We include several control conditions to validate our interpretation of results:

**Random Scrambling**: Comparison with random vocabulary replacement that does not preserve logical structure.

**Semantic Scrambling**: Replacement with semantically related but unfamiliar vocabulary to isolate pure familiarity effects.

**Syntactic Controls**: Scrambling of syntactic structure while preserving vocabulary to separate structural from lexical effects.

### 2.7 Computational Infrastructure and Implementation

All experiments are conducted using standardized computational infrastructure with documented hardware specifications, software versions, and environmental configurations. We implement careful temperature and sampling controls to ensure consistent and reproducible model behavior across all experimental conditions.

The implementation uses containerized environments with fixed dependency versions, enabling exact replication of experimental conditions. All experimental code follows open science practices with complete version control and documentation of experimental parameters.

This comprehensive methodology provides a robust framework for distinguishing reasoning from pattern matching in Large Language Models while maintaining strict standards for reproducibility and scientific rigor.
